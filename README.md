# PDP-8
This repository contains many sebroutines and programs that I have written while playing with my PiDP8/I kit.  The emulator software, along with a bunch of documentation can be found at the [TangentSoft repository](https://github.com/tangentsoft/pidp8i).  

## Getting started
If you are just getting started with PDP-8 or PAL assembly writing, there are a number of useful beginner programs to familiarize yourself with the language.  I've organized them into, what I consider to be, a logical path where each program builds on the previous ones.

1. [Simple Binary Counter](https://github.com/jnpastin/pdp8/tree/fde49c210e1b7b92a05a78c5bde8a77461be13e1/Simple_Binary_Counter)
2. [Two Value Adder](https://github.com/jnpastin/pdp8/tree/fde49c210e1b7b92a05a78c5bde8a77461be13e1/Two_Value_Adder)
